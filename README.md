I made a voting pool for some products so the client can use the data to decide what items to show on a catalog 
The user will choose between 3 products every round and the data will be gathered along the voting session 
and at last, a list that contains the voting data can be displayed by pressing a button. i added  chart to represent the data clearly. then used a local storage to store the calculations and count over it.
